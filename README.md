# IoT-Autonomous-Car
Progress of my IoT Autonomous Model Car. The car uses two microcontrollers for parallel sensory input. All data from board 2 is sent to board 1 for uploading to webserver or Sonar Excel Graphing Software System.

### Video of the car in Sept. 2022. Since then, an ESP-8266 microcontroller has been added to the car, serial connected to the Arduino Pro Micro, and IoT connected for WiFi communication to a webserver.
